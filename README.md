Volsbb-Login
====
This repo has the code for:
`https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nikhilvermavit.vlog`

I wrote this app in 2015 for our college Wifi Auto Login 
and for handling multiple accounts.
Some endpoints URL's may have changed after I graduated. 

Code quality is not good, feel free to fork it and play around with the code.
Also, there is some issue with Gradle build, as I had an older version of Android Studio.

This App was developed for students of Vit Vellore, but it will work with any Pronto Networks host.

* Feature to login via the app
* Feature to auto-reconnect in the background in some time intervals
* Feature to have multiple accounts
* Feature for internet usage
